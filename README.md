# Twist in the Tale exercises

Each chapter includes a few Twist in the Tale exercises.

For these exercises, I’ve tried to use modified code from
the examples already covered in a chapter, and the “Twist
in the Tale” title refers to modified or tweaked code.

These exercises highlight how even small code modifications
can change the behavior of your code.

They should encourage you to carefully examine all of the
code in the exam.

My main reason for including these exercises is that on the real exam, you may get to
answer more than one question that seems to define exactly the same question and answer
options.

But upon closer inspection, you’ll realize that these questions differ slightly, and
that these differences change the behavior of the code and the correct answer option.

The answers to all of the Twist in the Tale exercises are given in the appendix.
